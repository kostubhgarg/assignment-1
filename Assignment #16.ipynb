    "#Question 1\n",
    "MongoDB is a non-relational document database that provides support for JSON-like storage. \n",
    "The MongoDB database has a flexible data model that enables you to store unstructured data, and it provides full indexing support,\n",
    "and replication with rich and intuitive APIs.\n",
    "A non-relational database is a database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns found in most \n",
    "traditional database systems.\n",
    "One of the most attractive features of MongoDB is its reliable scalability. As opposed to SQL databases that utilize \n",
    "vertical scalability, MongoDB (like other NoSQL databases) uses shards for horizontal scalability, which makes it \n",
    "easier to increase storage capacity. Because of its expressive query language, many users find MongoDB query syntax \n",
    "to be rather simple and much easier to understand than SQL. "

    "(i)Support ad hoc queries - In MongoDB, you can search by field, range query and it also supports regular expression searches.\n",
    "(ii)Indexing - You can index any field in a document.\n",
    "(iii) Replication - MongoDB supports Master Slave replication. A master can perform Reads and Writes and a Slave copies data \n",
    "from the master and can only be used for reads or back up (not writes)\n",
    "(iv) Duplication of data - MongoDB can run over multiple servers. The data is duplicated to keep the system up and also keep its running condition \n",
    "in case of hardware failure.\n",
    "(v) Load balancing - It has an automatic load balancing configuration because of data placed in shards."
